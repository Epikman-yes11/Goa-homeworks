#  3 rules that shouldnt be broken in python while using variables




#1:


#variable must not start with a number or a digit

#for example

5 = 5

#it will show an error


#variable can only contain letters underscores and numbers
#for example
price = 12

#variable must start with a letter or an underscore character
#for example
_number = 123
price = 123
